# üõ°Ô∏è SkillSync Security Maintenance Guide

## üìã **Overview**

This guide ensures that the comprehensive security features implemented in SkillSync are maintained and protected during future development. Based on our September 15, 2025 security implementations, this document provides actionable checklists, validation steps, and best practices to prevent security regression.

---

## üîê **Critical Security Features to Maintain**

### **1. Enhanced JWT Authentication System**

#### **Backend Configuration (`skillsync-be/config/constants.py`)**
**‚úÖ VERIFY THESE SETTINGS REMAIN UNCHANGED:**

```python
NINJA_JWT_CONFIG = {
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Access token lifetime MUST remain 5 minutes max
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=5),
    
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Refresh token rotation MUST remain enabled
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True,
    
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Token blacklisting MUST remain enabled
    'BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION': True,
    
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Security settings MUST be maintained
    'AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE': ENVIRONMENT != 'development',
    'AUTH_COOKIE_HTTP_ONLY': True,
    'AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE': 'Strict',
}
```

#### **Frontend Implementation (`skillsync-fe/context/AuthContext.tsx`)**
**‚úÖ VERIFY THESE FEATURES REMAIN INTACT:**

- ‚úÖ **Memory-only access token storage** (never localStorage)
- ‚úÖ **HTTP-only refresh cookies** (automatic session restoration)
- ‚úÖ **Token expiry tracking** with real-time monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Automatic token refresh** before expiration

#### **üö® SECURITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**

1. **Token Lifetime Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Run this command to verify token configuration
   cd skillsync-be
   python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; print('Access Token Lifetime:', settings.NINJA_JWT['ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME'])"
   ```

2. **Cookie Security Verification:**
   - Check that cookies have `HttpOnly` flag set
   - Verify `Secure` flag in production
   - Confirm `SameSite=Strict` for maximum CSRF protection

3. **Session Restoration Test:**
   - Refresh browser page while authenticated
   - Session should restore automatically without logout
   - Access token should be in memory, refresh token in HTTP-only cookie

---

### **2. Mandatory Super Admin OTP Enforcement**

#### **Backend Implementation (`skillsync-be/otps/mutation.py`)**
**‚úÖ CRITICAL CODE THAT MUST NEVER BE CHANGED:**

```python
# SUPER ADMIN ALWAYS REQUIRES OTP - Lines 55-58
if user.role == 'super_admin':
    requires_otp = True
    # Continue to send OTP, don't return early
```

#### **üö® SUPER ADMIN SECURITY VALIDATION:**

1. **OTP Enforcement Test:**
   ```bash
   # Test super admin OTP requirement
   # 1. Create super admin test account
   # 2. Attempt login from trusted device
   # 3. MUST still require OTP verification
   # 4. Regular users with trusted devices should skip OTP
   ```

2. **Device Trust Bypass Prevention:**
   - Super admins CANNOT skip OTP even with trusted devices
   - Regular users CAN skip OTP with trusted devices
   - First-time logins ALWAYS require OTP regardless of role

#### **Frontend Validation (`skillsync-fe/context/AuthContext.tsx`)**
**‚úÖ VERIFY OTP FLOW REMAINS INTACT:**

- Super admin login triggers OTP requirement
- Device trust check works for regular users
- OTP verification UI displays properly
- Post-OTP authentication completes successfully

---

### **3. Trusted Device Management System**

#### **Backend Security (`skillsync-be/otps/models.py`)**
**‚úÖ DEVICE FINGERPRINTING MUST REMAIN SECURE:**

```python
@staticmethod
def generate_device_fingerprint(ip_address, user_agent):
    """Generate secure device fingerprint"""
    combined = f"{ip_address}{user_agent}"
    return hashlib.sha256(combined.encode()).hexdigest()[:32]
```

#### **üö® DEVICE TRUST VALIDATION:**

1. **Fingerprint Generation Test:**
   - Device fingerprints should be consistent for same device
   - Different devices should generate different fingerprints
   - Fingerprints should be hashed and truncated to 32 characters

2. **Trust Management Test:**
   - Users can trust devices after OTP verification
   - Trusted devices skip OTP for regular users
   - Super admins always require OTP regardless of device trust
   - Inactive devices are automatically cleaned up

---

### **4. Security Headers & Middleware**

#### **Backend Security Headers (`skillsync-be/core/settings/base.py`)**
**‚úÖ CRITICAL SECURITY HEADERS:**

```python
# Security Headers - MUST REMAIN ENABLED
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'

# Session Security - MUST REMAIN STRICT
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = ENVIRONMENT != 'development'
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Strict'

# CSRF Protection - MUST REMAIN ENABLED
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = ENVIRONMENT != 'development'
CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Strict'
```

#### **Frontend Middleware (`skillsync-fe/middleware.ts`)**
**‚úÖ ROUTE PROTECTION MUST REMAIN INTACT:**

- Role-based access control for protected routes
- Authentication validation from HTTP-only cookies
- Proper redirects for unauthorized access
- Development mode safeguards

---

### **5. Email & OTP Security**

#### **Backend OTP Security (`skillsync-be/otps/models.py`)**
**‚úÖ CRITICAL OTP SECURITY FEATURES:**

```python
# OTP Security - MUST REMAIN INTACT
- Hashed OTP storage (never plaintext in database)
- 10-minute expiration window
- Maximum 3 verification attempts
- Single-use OTP validation
- Purpose-specific OTP binding
```

#### **üö® OTP SECURITY VALIDATION:**

1. **OTP Storage Test:**
   - Check database - OTPs should be hashed, never plaintext
   - Verify expiration timestamps are enforced
   - Confirm attempt limiting works

2. **Email Security Test:**
   - OTP emails should be professional and branded
   - Verification links should work as fallback
   - Email delivery should have fallback mechanisms

## üîß **Testing & Validation**

### **Security Test Scenarios:**

1. **Authentication Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Super admin OTP enforcement
   - Login as super admin with trusted device ‚Üí MUST require OTP
   - Login as regular user with trusted device ‚Üí SHOULD skip OTP
   - Login as new user ‚Üí MUST require OTP
   ```

2. **Token Security Tests:**
   ```bash
   # JWT token validation
   - Check access token expires in 5 minutes
   - Verify refresh token rotation works
   - Confirm tokens are blacklisted after rotation
   ```

3. **Device Trust Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Device fingerprinting
   - Same device generates consistent fingerprint
   - Different devices generate different fingerprints
   - Trust assignment works after OTP verification
   ```

### **Automated Security Checks:**

1. **Pre-deployment Script:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Security validation script
   
   echo "üîç Checking JWT configuration..."
   python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; assert settings.NINJA_JWT['ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME'].total_seconds() <= 300, 'Token lifetime too long!'"
   
   echo "üîç Checking OTP enforcement..."
   grep -n "if user.role == 'super_admin':" otps/mutation.py || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Super admin OTP check missing!"
   
   echo "üîç Checking security headers..."
   grep -n "SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True" core/settings/base.py || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è XSS filter disabled!"
   
   echo "‚úÖ Security checks completed"
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDER**

**This security implementation represents months of careful development and testing. ANY changes to security-critical code MUST be reviewed by the security team and tested thoroughly. The security of our users' data depends on maintaining these protections.**

**When in doubt, consult this guide and test extensively. It's better to be overly cautious than to introduce a security vulnerability.**
