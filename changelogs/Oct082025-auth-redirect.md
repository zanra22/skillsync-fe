# Authentication Redirect Protection - October 8, 2025

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive authentication-based route protection that prevents authenticated users from accessing signin and signup pages, automatically redirecting them to their appropriate dashboard based on their role and onboarding status.

## Problem Statement
Authenticated users could still access the signin and signup pages, which could lead to confusion and poor user experience. Users should be automatically redirected to their dashboard when they try to access authentication pages while already logged in.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Centralized Redirect Utility (`lib/auth-redirect.ts`)
A reusable utility module for handling all authentication-based redirects:

#### Key Functions:
- **`getDashboardUrl(user)`**: Determines the correct dashboard based on user role
  - `super_admin` / `admin` â†’ `/dashboard` (Admin Dashboard)
  - `new-user` or incomplete onboarding â†’ `/onboarding`
  - All other roles â†’ `/user-dashboard` (User Dashboard)

- **`isAuthPage(pathname)`**: Checks if current path is signin/signup

- **`redirectAuthenticatedUser(user, isAuthenticated, currentPath)`**: Handles redirect logic
  - Returns `true` if redirect was initiated
  - Returns `false` if no redirect needed

- **`getRoleDisplayName(role)`**: Provides user-friendly role names for display

### 2. Updated Signin Page (`app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx`)
#### Changes:
- âœ… Imported `getDashboardUrl` from `@/lib/auth-redirect`
- âœ… Simplified redirect logic to use centralized utility
- âœ… Maintained existing `isRedirecting` state management
- âœ… Added console logging for debugging
- âœ… Shows loading state while redirecting authenticated users

#### Redirect Logic:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && user && !otpRequired) {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ User already authenticated, redirecting...', user.role);
    setIsRedirecting(true);
    
    const targetUrl = getDashboardUrl(user);
    console.log('ðŸŽ¯ Redirecting to:', targetUrl, 'for role:', user.role);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.href = targetUrl;
    }, 100);
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user, otpRequired]);
```

### 3. Updated Signup Page (`app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`)
#### Changes:
- âœ… Imported `getDashboardUrl` from `@/lib/auth-redirect`
- âœ… Added `isAuthenticated` and `user` from `useAuth()` hook
- âœ… Added `isRedirecting` state management
- âœ… Implemented redirect logic with `useEffect` (same pattern as signin)
- âœ… Added custom redirect UI component
- âœ… Updated `shouldShowSignupForm` logic to exclude `isRedirecting` state

#### New Redirect UI:
```tsx
if (isRedirecting) {
  return (
    <AuthLayout title="Already Signed In" subtitle="Redirecting you to your dashboard">
      <Card>
        <CardContent className="p-8 text-center space-y-6">
          <CheckCircle icon with pulse animation />
          <h2>You're already signed in!</h2>
          <p>Redirecting you to your dashboard...</p>
          <Progress bar with animation />
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </AuthLayout>
  );
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Authenticated User Visits `/signin`
1. Page loads
2. `useEffect` detects `isAuthenticated === true`
3. `isRedirecting` state set to `true`
4. User sees loading spinner with message: "Redirecting to your dashboard..."
5. Automatic redirect to appropriate dashboard (100ms delay)

### Scenario 2: Authenticated User Visits `/signup`
1. Page loads
2. `useEffect` detects `isAuthenticated === true`
3. `isRedirecting` state set to `true`
4. User sees custom redirect UI: "You're already signed in!"
5. Automatic redirect to appropriate dashboard (100ms delay)

### Scenario 3: Admin User on Auth Pages
1. Redirect to `/dashboard` (Admin Dashboard)

### Scenario 4: New User or Incomplete Onboarding
1. Redirect to `/onboarding` (Onboarding Flow)

### Scenario 5: Regular User
1. Redirect to `/user-dashboard` (User Dashboard)

## Role-Based Redirect Mapping

| User Role | Onboarding Status | Redirect Destination |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `super_admin` | Any | `/dashboard` |
| `admin` | Any | `/dashboard` |
| `new-user` | Any | `/onboarding` |
| Any role | `onboarding_completed: false` | `/onboarding` |
| `learner` | Completed | `/user-dashboard` |
| `mentor` | Completed | `/user-dashboard` |
| `premium_user` | Completed | `/user-dashboard` |
| Other roles | Completed | `/user-dashboard` |

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- React hooks: `useEffect`, `useState`
- Next.js: `useRouter` (for future enhancements)
- Auth Context: `useAuth()` hook
- TypeScript: Strict typing for user roles

### State Management
- `isRedirecting`: Local state to show loading/redirect UI
- `isAuthenticated`: From AuthContext
- `user`: User object from AuthContext
- `otpRequired`: Prevents redirect during OTP verification

### Performance Considerations
- 100ms setTimeout before redirect for smooth UX
- Early return in render to prevent form flash
- Conditional rendering based on redirect state

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents authenticated users from re-authenticating
2. **UX Improvement**: No confusion about being on wrong page
3. **Role-Based Access**: Automatic routing to appropriate dashboard
4. **Centralized Logic**: Reusable redirect utility for future features
5. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for redirect logic
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Authenticated admin user redirects from `/signin` to `/dashboard`
- [x] Authenticated admin user redirects from `/signup` to `/dashboard`
- [x] New user redirects to `/onboarding`
- [x] User with incomplete onboarding redirects to `/onboarding`
- [x] Regular authenticated user redirects to `/user-dashboard`
- [x] Unauthenticated user can access `/signin`
- [x] Unauthenticated user can access `/signup`
- [x] No form flash or UI glitches during redirect
- [x] Loading states display correctly
- [x] Console logs show correct redirect paths

## Future Enhancements

1. **Middleware Protection**: Add Next.js middleware for server-side redirect
2. **Route Guards**: Create HOC for protecting other routes
3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Add "return to dashboard" links
4. **Session Validation**: Check token expiry before redirect
5. **Analytics**: Track redirect patterns for UX insights
