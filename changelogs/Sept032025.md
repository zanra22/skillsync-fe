# Changelog: September 3, 2025

This document outlines the development activities, component refactoring, and feature enhancements completed today. The focus was on improving code reusability, fixing bugs, and enhancing the user experience with animations and smoother navigation.

---

## 1. Bug Fixes

### `(auth)/signin/page.tsx`
- **Issue**: A critical syntax error was present in the sign-in page file due to a duplicated `SignInPage` component definition.
- **Resolution**: The extraneous and duplicated code block was identified and removed, resolving the syntax error and allowing the component to render correctly.

---

## 2. Component Refactoring & Reusability

To promote a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codebase and ensure brand consistency, several UI elements were extracted into their own reusable components.

### a. `components/Logo.tsx`
- **File Created**: `e:\Projects\skillsync-latest\frontend\components\Logo.tsx`
- **Description**: A new component, `Logo`, was created to encapsulate the SkillSync SVG logo. Previously, this SVG code was hardcoded into multiple files.
- **Usage**:
    - The component accepts standard SVG props, including `className`, allowing for flexible styling (e.g., adjusting width and height).
    - It renders the complex, multi-layered SVG path data for the brand's logo.
    - The internal `<linearGradient>` uses CSS variables (`hsl(var(--primary))`, `hsl(var(--accent))`) to adapt to the application's theme (light/dark mode).
- **Implementation**:
    - The `Logo` component was subsequently imported and used in:
        - `app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx`
        - `components/Navigation.tsx`

### b. `components/Brand.tsx`
- **File Created**: `e:\Projects\skillsync-latest\frontend\components\Brand.tsx`
- **Description**: A simple but effective component, `Brand`, was created to render the brand name "SkillSync".
- **Usage**:
    - This component centralizes the brand name and its specific styling (`gradient-text`).
    - It uses the `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` to merge the default `gradient-text` class with any additional `className` props passed to it.
    - This ensures the brand name is always displayed with the correct gradient effect and provides an easy way to apply it throughout the app.
- **Implementation**:
    - The `Brand` component was used to replace hardcoded instances of "SkillSync" in:
        - `app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx`
        - `components/Navigation.tsx`
        - `components/Mentorship.tsx`

---

## 3. UI/UX Enhancements

### a. Sign-In Page (`signin/page.tsx`) Layout Update
- **Change**: The main heading on the sign-in page was modified for better visual hierarchy. The "Welcome back to" text now appears on one line, with the `<Brand />` name appearing on the line below it. This was achieved by wrapping the first part of the text in a `<span className="text-white block">`.
- **Change**: A `Logo` component, wrapped in a Next.js `<Link>` pointing to the homepage (`/`), was added to the top-left corner of the page. It is positioned absolutely, creating a consistent brand presence that mirrors the position of the theme toggle button on the top-right.

### b. Smooth Scrolling Navigation (`Navigation.tsx`)
- **Feature**: Implemented a smooth scrolling effect for on-page anchor links in the main navigation.
- **Function**: `handleScroll(e, href)`
    - This function is triggered on-click for navigation links (`#features`, `#mentorship`, etc.).
    - It prevents the default browser jump behavior using `e.preventDefault()`.
    - It programmatically finds the target section by its ID and uses the `elem.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" })` Web API to create a fluid scrolling animation to that section.
    - For the mobile menu, it also includes logic to automatically close the menu overlay after a link is clicked.

### c. Framer Motion Animations (`Navigation.tsx`)
- **Dependency**: The `framer-motion` library was added to the project (`npm install framer-motion`).
- **Feature**: Subtle animations were added to the navigation bar to improve user feedback and visual appeal.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Mobile Menu**: The mobile menu now animates its appearance and disappearance. It slides down and fades in when opened, and reverses the animation when closed. This is achieved using `AnimatePresence` and `motion.div` with predefined variants (`hidden`, `visible`, `exit`).
    - **Theme Toggle Icon**: The sun and moon icons in the theme toggle button now have a fade-and-slide transition. When the theme is changed, the current icon animates out while the new one animates in, providing a seamless visual transition. This was also implemented using `AnimatePresence` and `motion.div`.

## 4. Authentication & Data Fetching Layer

A robust, type-safe, and scalable authentication and data fetching layer has been implemented using TanStack Query, Zod, and a structured API service.

### a. `providers/query-provider.tsx`
- **Purpose**: This file establishes the foundation for TanStack Query in the application.
- **Component**: `QueryProvider`
- **Usage**: This provider wraps the entire application (in `layout.tsx`), making the Query Client available to all components.
- **Functionality**:
    - It initializes a `QueryClient` with global default options for all queries and mutations, ensuring consistent behavior for caching (`staleTime`, `gcTime`), retries, and refetching logic.
    - It conditionally renders `ReactQueryDevtools` in the development environment, providing a powerful tool for debugging cache state and API requests.

### b. `types/auth/dto.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Defines the data contracts (Data Transfer Objects) for all authentication-related API endpoints.
- **Usage**: These TypeScript interfaces are used across the API service, query hooks, and components to ensure type safety when sending or receiving data.
- **Key Interfaces**:
    - `SignInRequestDto`, `SignInResponseDto`: Define the shape of data for sign-in requests and the expected server response (user object, tokens).
    - `SignUpRequestDto`, `SignUpResponseDto`: For user registration.
    - `ApiErrorDto`: A standardized shape for error responses from the backend, ensuring consistent error handling.
    - Other DTOs cover password reset, email verification, and social authentication flows.

### c. `lib/validations/auth.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralizes all client-side validation logic for authentication forms using the `zod` library.
- **Usage**: These schemas are used with `react-hook-form` (via `@hookform/resolvers/zod`) to provide real-time, type-safe validation for user input.
- **Key Schemas**:
    - `signInSchema`: Validates email and password fields.
    - `signUpSchema`: Includes more complex validation, such as password strength regex and a `.refine()` check to ensure `password` and `confirmPassword` match.
    - `changePasswordSchema`: Demonstrates chained refinements to ensure the new password is not the same as the current one.
- **Type Exports**: For each schema, a TypeScript type (e.g., `SignInFormData`) is inferred and exported, which is then used to type the form state in components.

### d. `api/auth/signin.tsx`
- **Purpose**: This file is the core of the API communication layer. It abstracts away the `fetch` API and provides a clean, reusable service for making authenticated requests.
- **Key Exports**:
    - **`apiClient<T>`**: A generic and robust function for making HTTP requests. It automatically sets the API base URL, JSON headers, and attaches the JWT `Authorization` header from `localStorage`.
    - **`ApiError`**: A custom error class that standardizes how API errors are handled. It captures the HTTP status code and detailed error messages from the backend, allowing for more precise error handling in the UI.
    - **`tokenManager`**: A utility object that encapsulates all interactions with `localStorage` for setting, getting, and clearing authentication tokens and their expiry.
    - **`authApi`**: An object that exposes a set of methods, each corresponding to a specific backend endpoint (e.g., `authApi.signIn(...)`, `authApi.getProfile()`). These methods use the `apiClient` to perform the actual network request.

### e. `lib/queries/auth.ts`
- **Purpose**: This file connects the API service (`authApi`) to the UI layer through TanStack Query's custom hooks. It encapsulates all server state logic related to authentication.
- **Usage**: Components use these hooks to trigger API calls and manage the resulting state (loading, data, error) without interacting directly with the API service.
- **Key Hooks**:
    - **`useSignIn()`**: A `useMutation` hook for handling user login. On `onSuccess`, it uses `tokenManager` to store tokens, updates the user profile in the TanStack Query cache using `queryClient.setQueryData`, and displays a success toast. On `onError`, it shows an error toast.
    - **`useProfile()`**: A `useQuery` hook to fetch the current user's profile. It's conditionally `enabled` based on the presence and validity of the access token. It uses `staleTime` to prevent excessive refetching.
    - **`useSignOut()`**: A `useMutation` hook that calls the sign-out endpoint. Crucially, it clears tokens and removes all auth-related queries from the cache on success or error, ensuring a clean state logout.
    - **`useAuth()`**: A custom hook that combines `useProfile` to provide a simple, ready-to-use authentication context (`{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading }`) for components.
